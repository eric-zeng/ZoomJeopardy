[ Complete User Guide ](https://www.mfrederickson.com/ZoomJeopardy/userguide)

[Zoom Jeopardy](https://mfrederickson.com/ZoomJeopardy) lets you host Jeopardy games for friends over Zoom, with all the bells and whistles of the real broadcast show. You can play over 1,000 full archival Jeopardy games, or write your own clues and answers.


[Zoom Jeopardy](https://mfrederickson.com/ZoomJeopardy) runs inside TouchDesigner, an application which runs on Mac and Windows and handles the video compositing, clues, scores, and sound. TouchDesigner is free for noncommercial use.


As a host, you’ll run a game by starting a Zoom call with players. You’ll distribute a “[green screen](https://tinyurl.com/zoombg123)” for players to set as their virtual background. You’ll arrange their video on your screen, and select the region of screen their video occupies - [Zoom Jeopardy](https://mfrederickson.com/ZoomJeopardy) will handle grabbing that live video and compositing it into the game.

To get started:

1. Download and install [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com)

If you go poking around in the Touch file to make changes, most of the interesting stuff lives in /jeopardy/jeopardyGame, a text DAT.

To any of you who build in Touch, I’m sorry the main /jeopardy section is not in containers. I never intended for the project to get this big when I started and wanted to get this out fast. Also, apologies about the inconsistent use of GAME_STATE. I got lazy.
